		<div class="content col-1-1">
			<p class="push-1-12 col-5-12">I am a young woman, who finds it exciting to work with graphic design and code.  I am inquisitive with regards to various tools. I am currently working with vector graphics, prototyping, HTML 5, CSS 3 and have been introduced to web responsive design, javascript and jQuery plugins. In addition, I also work with project planning.<br> 
			I work best under structured conditions and gladly in teams. I like to try different things to challenge myself and have varied types of work tasks.<br> 
			I study media design at CPH Business Academy Lyngby, which is a Danish education, so all my documentation is in Danish. <br><br></p>
			<p class="col-5-12">I am broadly based culturally. I have since childhood loved books, movies, theater, music, video games and going to museums.<br> 
			Literature: My favourite genre is fantasy, but I also read classic crimes such as Agatha Christie.<br> 
			Movies: I am preferential to action and adventure movies, and I've loved Star Wars since I was four years old. But I am open to all genres.<br>
			Theater: I enjoy going to see ballet, musicals, drama and revue, which I have had the pleasure of doing so many times.<br>
			Music: I have a broad taste in music, but the favourites are classic rock and classical music. I especially love classic rock played with a classical orchestra.<br>
			Video games: My favourite genre is role-playing and action-adventure.<br>
			Museums: I have traveled most of the world with my family, and I enjoy exploring other cultures and their history. </p>
